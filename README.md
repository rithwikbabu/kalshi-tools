# kalshi-tools

This repository contains tools for experimenting with Kalshi markets.

## Orderbook viewer

A minimal, unauthenticated orderbook viewer is available in [`viewer/index.html`](viewer/index.html).
Open the file in a browser and enter a Kalshi market ticker to see a live bar chart of the order book.
Click on any bar to trigger a mock order placement.

> **Note:** This is an MVP that uses public API endpoints and does not submit real orders.
